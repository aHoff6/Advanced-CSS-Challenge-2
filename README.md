# Advanced-CSS-Challenge-2

## Description

As a student learning web development, I want to create a profile webpage where I can showcase my work along with a brief About Me and contact info. 

## Installation

To install this project to get the development environment running:

1. Clone GitHub repository here; https://github.com/aHoff6/Advanced-CSS-Challenge-2
by clicking the green "code" button and copying the URL.

2. Open the Command Line and change the directory to where you would like to clone the directory.

3. Type the command "git clone" followed by the URL you copied earlier and press enter.

## Usage

At top of the webpage is the navigation bar with three choices, when clicked, the webpage will scroll to the corresponding section. 'My Work' section has a screenshot of previous work, when the image is clicked it will bring you to the deployed webpage. This page is flexible, responsive to different size screens, and has media queries to alter features at a set px amount.
